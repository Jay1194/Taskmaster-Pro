# Taskmaster-Pro

## Description
I've built a project tracker online that follows the Kanban method. Think of it as a digital board where work tasks move through different columns like "To Do," "In Progress," or "Complete." This tool connects with other online services using web APIs to share and get data. To make it work, I've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface that you can interact with. I've also added extra features using pre-built tools like jQuery and Bootstrap.
